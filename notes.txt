    the user

    via url and method

3) Where does a form submit data to?
    the server view function whose url matches form action url and method

4) What happens when we return a redirect?
    returns a redirect response, which then forces browser to visit specified url
    starts a new HTTP cycle, and resets the url, because it returns a different view function

5) What happens when we return a render?
    sends a HTTP request for the url, on top of previous HTTP requests
